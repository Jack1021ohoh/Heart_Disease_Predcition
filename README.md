# Heart Disease Predcition

---
### Description
This project is the midterm project for the Data Mining And Knowledge Discovery course, where we used Python to develop a model for analyzing and predicting the likelihood of a person experiencing a heart disease. The project involved several key techniques that enhanced the model's performance and accuracy.

During the model training, I used Grid Search combined with 5-fold Cross-Validation to find the best hyperparameters and evaluate the models' performance. After training the models, I used feature importance and Shapley Values to find out the important factors associated with heart disease. Moreover, I utilized PSO and mRMR to perform feature selection, and compared the effect of using two types of feature selection on model performance.
