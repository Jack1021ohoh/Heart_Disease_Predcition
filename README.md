# Heart Disease Predcition

---
### Description
This project is the midterm project for the Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery course, where I used Python to develop models for predicting the likelihood of a person experiencing heart disease. The project incorporated several advanced techniques to enhance the model's performance and accuracy.

During model training, I employed Grid Search in combination with 5-fold Cross-Validation to optimize hyperparameters and rigorously evaluate the models' performance. After training, I utilized feature importance and Shapley Values to identify the key factors associated with heart disease. Additionally, I implemented feature selection using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR), and conducted a comparative analysis to assess how each method impacted model performance.
